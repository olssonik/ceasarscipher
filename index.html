        <h1>Ceasar`s Cipher</h1>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Caesar's cipher, also known as the Caesar shift or Caesar's code, is a simple
            substitution cipher used for encryption. It is named after Julius Caesar, who is believed to have used this
            method to communicate secretly with his military commanders.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The encryption process in Caesar's cipher involves shifting each letter of the
            plaintext a certain number of positions down the alphabet. The shifting value, often referred to as the key
            or the shift, determines how many positions each letter is moved. For example, with a shift of 3, the letter
            'A' would be replaced by 'D', 'B' by 'E', and so on.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Here's a step-by-step explanation of the encryption process using Caesar's cipher:
        </p>
        <ol style="text-align: left;">
            <li>
                <p>Choose a shift value (key) to determine how many positions each letter should be shifted. For
                    example, a shift of 3 means 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Take the plaintext message that you want to encrypt.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Iterate through each letter of the plaintext message.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For each letter, shift it by the specified number of positions. Wrap around to the beginning of the
                    alphabet if necessary. Maintain the case of the letters (uppercase remains uppercase, and lowercase
                    remains lowercase).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Replace the original letter with the shifted letter to create the ciphertext.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Continue this process for each letter in the plaintext, until the entire message has been encrypted.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The resulting ciphertext is the encrypted form of the original plaintext. To
            decrypt the message, the receiver needs to know the shift value and can reverse the process by shifting each
            letter back by the same number of positions.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">While Caesar's cipher was effective in ancient times, it is now considered
            extremely weak and can be easily decrypted through simple frequency analysis or by trying all possible shift
            values. Therefore, it is mainly used for educational purposes or as a basic building block for more complex
            encryption algorithms.</p>
